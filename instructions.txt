Prerequisites: see readme.txt

1, Start the Application: Run the Python script. A window titled "Heatmap Generator" will open.

2. Load JSON Data:

Click on the "Load JSON" button.
Navigate to the location of your JSON file in the dialog that appears. The JSON file should contain data in the following format:

[
    {"x": value1, "y": value2},
    ...
]

Select the file and click "Open". The application will read the data and generate a heatmap based on the 'x' and 'y' coordinates found in the JSON file. The heatmap will be displayed in a new window.

3. Save Heatmap:

After viewing the generated heatmap, click on the "Save Heatmap" button to save the visualization.
Choose your desired save location and file name in the dialog that appears. Ensure the file extension is .png.
Click "Save" to export the heatmap image to your chosen location.
